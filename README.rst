IGEscapePassingDatePicker
=========================

It's really simple: an NSDatePicker subclass that overrides keyDown: to check if the key pressed is the escape key; if so, pass it to the next responder; if not, pass it to NSDatePicker's keyDown: method. I'm only even bothering to post it because I didn't readily find such a thing.
